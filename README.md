# Piradigm
This project is my entry for the Raspberry Pi Robot competition PiWars, 
2018. The hardware is a Tiny 4WD robot kit from Coretec Robotics, with a 
Picon zero motor controller from 4Tronix, a Raspberry Pi 3, Pi camera, 
2.8" PiTFT with touchscreen and a RockCandy wireless controller. The 
objective is to enter all the competition's challenges autonomously, 
using the camera as the only sensor.

So far only manual control is working, autonomous routines will be 
coming soon.
